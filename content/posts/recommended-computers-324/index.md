As a professional nerd, I have had many people ask me for my opinion on various computer purchases. Because of this, I have decided to write a small blog post to list out a few of my own personal recommendations for different computing scenarios.

## Gaming Desktops

Let's start with one of the most common computer questions that I get asked, "Should I buy this pre-built gaming pc??". The answer is no. More often than not you can get more bang for your buck by just building your own. By building your own gaming PC you can also get exactly what you want, and you don't have to settle for things like you might have to with a pre-built gaming PC.

A good site to piece together your own gaming PC build is [PcPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/).

## Basic Desktops

If you are just looking for a basic desktop for casual use or even professional work, you have some great options to choose from. I personally would recommend a used Dell Optiplex. You can find a variety of different specs to suit your needs and most of them are easily upgradable. Most are listed at a reasonable price as well. A lot of companies offload these whenever they run out of warranty and upgrade their systems. In short, business grade desktop for an affordable price with a variety of options for specs.

Here is one great option that I found from a quick search.

## Gaming Laptops

Don't. Just don't.

Stay far away. The laptop form factor does not allow for adequate airflow, especially for the components required for high performance gaming. Components are soldered and cannot be easily replaced either. You will pay through the nose for a decent gaming laptop and it will fail.

## Basic Laptops

Just like with a basic desktop, you have many options to choose from when looking for a laptop to use for casual use or even professional work. I would once again recommend you look at the used market for the same reasons as with the basic desktop. Many companies offload their laptops once the warranties are out and you can grab a professional grade laptop for relatively cheap. Some of the Lenovo Thinkpads are excellent options because of price, but also repairability. For instance, a Thinkpad T480 can have pretty much everything repaired on it for cheap.

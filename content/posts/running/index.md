Since about my sophomore year of high-school I have been into running as a form of exercise. I love the feeling of accomplishment after a long run and being able to just zone out and listen to music while being outdoors. I just got back from my first outdoor run of the year (it is finally warm enough üòÅ) and thought that I should write a short blog post about running and my experiences to maybe encourage others.

## The Pros of Running

It should be a given that running is a great form of exercise and can increase your overall health, but running also has other benefits that you should consider. Running can be a form of meditation. Stepping away from the desk and just getting outside on a nice sunny day can help you mentally check out from the stresses of your work or life. Slip into your best pair of running shoes, put on your favorite playlist and just disconnect from the world for a bit. It may not seem like much and if you aren't used to running then the stresses of the run may seem to counteract any relaxing benefits, but once you make running a habit the stresses of the run will begin to fade.

Running can allow you to make friends. I ran a lot in high-school by myself, but after others began seeing me on my runs, they began approaching me and asking me if I would be interested in joining the cross-country team which then eventually transformed into me joining the track team. You could have the same experiences, or you could find running groups within your area and join them.

If you are a competitive person and enjoy a good challenge, you could time your runs and look to best your times. You could also try and push yourself to run further, increasing your stamina for longer distances. This can help you find a healthy outlet for that competitive drive and, because you are just competing with yourself, you don't have to stress about hurt feelings.

These are just a few of the pros of running from my perspective. I encourage everyone to give it a shot and see if you can find other benefits that I have not listed. If you are new to running just remember to take it slow and pace yourself. The journey of running is a long process, and it's important to enjoy yourself and avoid injury.

Happy running! üôÇ
